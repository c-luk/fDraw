# RoadMap for fDraw

- ### Moving a shape should be possible
  - The dear user should be able to move (drag&drop) a created shape freely on the paint area

- ### Save/Load method
  - CTRL-S or a menu entry should let the user save the paint area to a file

#### done and dusted:
<br/>
- ### ~~the tools should have real functions. now, they're just for demo purposes.~~
  - ~~implement a box/rectangle-draw-method for dragging a box/rectangle on the paint area~~
  - ~~implement a line-draw-method for dragging a line on the paint area~~
  - ~~implement a delete button for renewing the paint area~~
